# FSQ_Modeling
Uses the Fundamental Surface of Quads to model key parameters of the galaxy cluster

## Using Java
The coding language used here is Java, so compiling is required before running any of the files. Whenever you need to compile a file, run the command
> javac <path/to/file>
Once compiled, run the file using the command
> java <path/to/file>

## Running the Code
The only file that you should need to run is 'fundamentalSurface/Surface.java'. Because I didn't include a config file, this is also the only file that you will need to edit parameters in.
### Key parameters
debug - boolean:  Leave this 'false' unless you want to look at the specific outputs of the code. Making it 'true' will flood your console with data that you won't need unless you're fixing an issue
